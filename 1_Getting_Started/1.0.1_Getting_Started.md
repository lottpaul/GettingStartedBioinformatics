# 1. Getting Started
Welcome to the Getting Started Bioinformatics Course


## Conventions
During this course, I'm going to use some conventions when I present code or demonstrate using the command-line.

### 1. Code or Terminal vs Course Text

When I want to highlight a code/Unix command or syntax, I will place it in a code block.   In line code blocks will look like `This is the Code`, while a larger code blocks I'll place on a separate line 

```python

import subprocess as sp
res = sp.run('ls', shell=True, check=True)
```

### 2. Command Line Inputs vs STDOUT/STDERR Outputs  (Command Prompt: $)

When I present a command on the command line, I'll prefix it with a `$` as this is the sign commonly used to depict that the SHELL is ready for you to type a command - called the `prompt`.  Following lines or lines that do not begin with a `$` denote outputs from the terminal shell.

**Example**
If I enter `ls` on the command line to list the files.
```
$ ls
Test.txt  Readme.md  Picture.jpg
```
The line under `$ ls` is the output from typing `ls`.  

<font color="red"><b>Important:</b></font>  When you practice using the same commands, make sure that you don't copy the `$` as in the examples denotes your/my prompt not a character you type.
